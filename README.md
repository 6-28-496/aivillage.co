This is a prototype of an idea a few of us had to create AI-powered synthetic personas that could answer a range of research questions. Note that I've added settings.py to .gitignore to conceal some of the production environment settings.

I've included resources for both Pip and Poetry. They were generated at the same time, so they should be equivalent - but if in doubt, use Pip.

I configured a PostgreSQL database for this project in production. For a demo of the full experience hosted on aivillage.co, contact me!
